### Rock Paper Scissors
Its my goto for learning something useful in a new language or framework.

Nothing about this repo is platform or language dependant. It mearly attempts to outline some goals associated with building a RPS game in a number of cohesive steps.

### Steps
1. Explore the Random Number Generator
2. Select an answer using a Random Selection
3. Build A RPS service that contains the rules for win, lose, and, draw
4. Make a Bot that can play the game
5. Make the bot smarter
6. Build an interface for the game for a human
