### Rock Paper Scissors
Its my goto for learning something useful in a new language or framework.

Nothing about this repo is platform or language dependant. It mearly attempts to outline some goals associated with building a RPS game in a number of cohesive steps.

### Steps
1. Explore the Random Number Generator [[STEP_ONE]]
2. Select an answer using a Random Selection
3. Build A RPS service that contains the rules for win, lose, and, draw
4. Make a Bot that can play the game
5. Make the bot smarter
6. Build an interface for the game for a human


### How to start
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it
3. Try and build something by putting your code right in your fork
4. If you get stuck `Open and Issue` on your fork and include `@ninjapanzer` in the issue somewhere
